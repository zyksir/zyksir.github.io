## Biography

Hi, I’m Yikai Zhu. I received my Master’s degree in Computer Science from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in 2023. Before that, I earned my Bachelor’s degree from Peking University in 2020. Between 2020 and 2021, I worked at ByteDance during my gap year, and after graduating from UCLA, I joined Alibaba, where I worked from July 2023 to June 2025.

My research and professional interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and high-performance computing.

Currently, I am focused on building efficient systems for generative AI and occasionally writing technical blogs. I also enjoy learning and contributing to open-source projects in my spare time.
